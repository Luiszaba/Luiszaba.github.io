This is it, we made it to our first project at Flatiron School...and it didn't go as planned. 

Now I don't want to rain on my parade just yet.  I learned more in the past week than I have in the past 2 weeks and here's why.  And if you are also just starting off on your journey into web development take a minute to read what I'm about to say... there is a major difference between following direction and implementation of the directions given.  More on that later.

Everyday when I wake up I scroll through tech new channels online and look to find something that peaks my interest.  So I thought to myself, why not take the time to build a scraper that will look through those websites, or companies I have an interest in, and scrape the latest news.  First I started off building a model of the CLI users would be working with.  A simple, integer input should be enough for this. After all it is my first gem. After that, things went a little out of sync.  With frequent drops in server connection large portions of code were frequently lost for the first two days.  Lucky for me I have a collegue in the course that led me to a simple guide to setting up a local IDE.  

With my local IDE set up I was now able to experience one of the most important moments in a developers life...get ready because you most likely won't believe me at first.  Ready?  Okay... I learned how to use github to pull, push, clone, fork, add, create SSH Keys and commit for the first time!  Now to you it might seem childish to find those things so interesting, but without those tools you lose the ability to communicate your code to a broader audience. Plus, you need to know how to use github if you want to find a job.  

Unlike most of the students in this course I decided to scrape multiple sites at once.  This ended up being the hardest thing I've done in a very long time.  I scraped the newsletters from Intel, AMD, Apple, Nvidia, and WccTech.   As it stands I can only get the title and date of the newsletter, which is enough for now.  My goal is to bring the entire newsletter to life with a url, description, and image associated with the newsletter.  

As of this moment, despite the gem not being perfect (it's getting there)  I am overjoyed with a feeling of accomplishment.  I did it.  I created something!  In the past three weeks I took direction, but for the first time I felt like I actually implimented the things I learned.  This was only the first gem, but I have a need to improve it as much and as often as I can.  It definitly wont be the last.
