After 6 long months, I have been tasked with completing the final project at Flatiron School.  Although I consider JavaScript my mortal enemy, I have a fond appreciation for its complexity. It's a rabid beast that needs to be tamed.  Being able to use Ruby on Rails as the back-end support and React/Redux for client side rendering was not something that I would see myself doing just one year ago.  Although this project is over I have already set my eyes on the next one.  I have not used any media in my projects, that being said I will create a YouTube like application.  Rails to handle the back-end, and React-Redux to operate on the front end.  

My final project isn't the most aesthetically pleasing application but I have many idea for what to do next.  My initial plan was to use the New York MTA (Metropolitan Transportation Authority) API by applying for a license offered to developers.  Although the MTA did giving me the right to use their pre-rendered maps, and transit icons, I was not granted rights to the API.  Under tight time constraints I opted to create my own API.  The application allowed a visitor to enter the page, create a song with a title, artist, length, and genre.  The newly generated addition to the API will render without reloading the page.  Visitors can also leave small comments.  Think of it like reddit, but with only one active topic.  A good next step would be to allow visitors to link YouTube music videos, or make use of Spotify developer tools. 

I had the most fun learning how to properly use thunk middle-ware, and React flow, Action > Reducer > Update State.  Three words that on the surface sound simple. Submit an action, the action is sent to a reducer or in other words function(s) and then the state of the page and API is updated.   All achievable by configuring two applications to communicate with each other.  Another fascinating aspect is the ability to use the browser as a router.  This allows for quick access to areas of the page that may have otherwise required whole page reloads.
