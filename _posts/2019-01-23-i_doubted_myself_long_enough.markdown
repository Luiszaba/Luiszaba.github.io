I, like many others in this course were born in the late 80s or early 90s.  We were thrown into a world that will eventually be dominated by the technology and automation.  As children we all remember our first day of computer class using the long dead PowerMac 5200, long live the PowerMac 5200.  Some of you may even go farther back to watching your parents, guardians, or older siblings playing video games on their game consoles.  For me, watching my mother play Super Mario Bros might have well been the most exciting thing in the world. I remember thinking to myself "How on Earth is she making the cartoon move?".  We grew up with so much technology it is no surprise some of us fell in love with the idea of learning to program our own video games, or  someday develop our own technologies.  I for one, never having been very good at math gave up on that idea long ago.  Now at 29 years old, I realize I was wrong. 

Now don't get me wrong, I never gave up on technology.  I gave up on learning how to turn those 1's and 0's into something entirely new.  I never give up on appreciating the vast wealth of knowledge required of someone to turn those 1's and 0's into the next Super Mario Bros.  

I remember when I was young my teacher over heard a few of us talking about video games, all my friends, myself included had the XBox.  His name was Mr.Peterson and he said something like this, "If you can spend hours talking about your video games, you can spend hours learning about how to build them yourself.  A XBox is just a computer.  You can build one at home."  It was at that moment a lightbulb went off.  I'm going to build my own computer.  My birthday was right around the corner so I badgered my father every day to let me try and build my own computer.  After a few days of research using hardware magazines *PC WORLD* was big at the time, I made a list of cheap components.  A few days later it was all ready.  I put everything together, turned it on and sadness took over because I didn't have an operating system.   Took an extra few days but it all came together.  It cost me my birthday and christmas but it was all worth it because I felt soo accomplished that I built something, and if I can build something I can build anything.  And that was it.  I never build another computer again until 2016, 12 years later.   

Like I said before, I was never good at Math.  I did'nt believe myself to ever be able to learn how to do something so simple as to `puts "Hello World"`.  Jump forward to 2017.  I'm leaving my job in the public sector to try working for a financial company.  To be honest, this was more like putting it all on Black and landing on Red.  While it didn't work out, i did get to meet some really amazing people that were the lead developers of the company.  I was asked if I would ever be interested in learning to code.  I with full confidence in what I was about to say said this, "I'm not bright enough for that".  I had so little confidence in my own abilities, that I gave up before ever giving it a chance.  But, this person believed anybody can learn to code.  He sent me a link to CodeAcademy and said, "You usually have a lot of free time on your hands given your position.  Take some time and see if you enjoy it."  And so I did. And I did for 6 hours that day.  I didn't do anything for 6 hours but try and learn.  Before I knew it, everybody had left and I was the only person still there.  That was it...I knew then and there, I was meant to code.  

So I did my research, and started precamp courses online whenever I had the chance.   One year later, 2018 I am out of a job.  Outsourcing reared it's ugly head and said "Sorry, but we have to let you go" , but please do not feel bad for me. For the first time in my life I feel free, and have fallen in love with learning to code.   

P.S.  If anyone has a old CRT monitor they are willing to part ways with, please let me know.  I'm feeling nostalgic today. 

Note: I built my first computer to play World Of Warcraft.
